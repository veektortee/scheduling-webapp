# [Info] Vercel Authentication Debug Guide

## Current Status Analysis

From your logs, I can see:

[Done] **Working:**
- Environment detection: `environment: 'serverless'` ✓
- Environment variable loading: `🌐 Loading credentials from environment variables` ✓
- System is using Vercel environment variables instead of files ✓

[Error] **Issues:**
- Authentication failing: `providedUsername: 'changetheuser'` doesn't match your `ADMIN_USERNAME`
- No backup email configured: `hasEmail: false`

## [Maintenance] Quick Fix

### Issue 1: Wrong Username
Your user is trying to log in with `'changetheuser'`, but your `ADMIN_USERNAME` environment variable is set to something else.

**Solution Options:**

**Option A: Update Your Login (Recommended)**
- Check what username you set in Vercel environment variables
- Use that username to log in instead of `'changetheuser'`

**Option B: Update Environment Variable**
- If you want to use `'changetheuser'` as the username:
  1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
  2. Update `ADMIN_USERNAME` to `changetheuser`
  3. Redeploy your app

### Issue 2: No Backup Email
**To enable credential recovery:**
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add `ADMIN_BACKUP_EMAIL` with your email address
3. Redeploy your app

## [Info] Check Your Current Environment Variables

Run this command to see what's currently set:

```bash
vercel env ls
```

You should see:
- `ADMIN_USERNAME` - This is what you need to use for login
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD` - Your login password
- `ADMIN_BACKUP_EMAIL` - Should be set for recovery
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - Should be a long random string
- `NEXTAUTH_URL` - Your Vercel app URL

## 🐛 Debug Your Current Setup

To see what username is actually configured, you can temporarily add this log to your authentication system or check the Vercel environment variables in the dashboard.

**Current Login Attempt:**
- Trying to use: `'changetheuser'`
- Expected format: email address (e.g., `admin@yourcompany.com`)

## [Goal] Immediate Action Items

1. **Find Your Actual Username:**
   - Check Vercel Dashboard → Environment Variables → `ADMIN_USERNAME`
   - Or update it to `changetheuser` if that's what you prefer

2. **Set Backup Email:**
   - Add `ADMIN_BACKUP_EMAIL` environment variable
   - Use your actual email address

3. **Test Login:**
   - Use the correct username from step 1
   - Use the password from your `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable

## 📱 Quick Commands

```bash
# Check current environment variables
vercel env ls

# Update username to match what you're trying to use
vercel env add ADMIN_USERNAME production
# Enter: changetheuser

# Add backup email
vercel env add ADMIN_BACKUP_EMAIL production  
# Enter: your-email@domain.com

# Redeploy
vercel --prod
```

## [Done] Success Indicators

After fixing, you should see logs like:
```
[Info] Credential validation: {
  environment: 'serverless',
  providedUsername: 'changetheuser',
  isValid: true  ← This should be true
}
[Done] Authentication successful
```

And for backup email:
```
📧 Backup email check: {
  environment: 'serverless',
  isConfigured: true,  ← Should be true
  hasEmail: true       ← Should be true
}
```
